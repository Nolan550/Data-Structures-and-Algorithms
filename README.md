# Data Structures and Algorithms 
Welcome to **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository.
This repository contains well-explained implementations of common data structures algorithms written in both Java and Python.
The goal of this repository is to help me(and others) understand how these structures work internally through manual implementation, not just a built-in library.

## Repository Structure
Each topic has its own folder with:
- Source code
- Explanation Comments
- Example Usage
- Notes or Diagrams

  ## Data Structures
  - [custom Array](Arrays/readme.md)
  - [Linked List](LinkedLists/readme.md)
  - [Stack](Stack/readme.md)
  - [Queue](Queue/readme.md)


### Algorithms (Coming Soon)
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Trees
- Basic and Intermediate Graph Algorithms

  ## Goals of this repository
  - Understand how core data structures work internally
  - Practice algorithm implementation using Python and Java
  - Improve problem-solving and logical thinking
 
## Technologies Used
- **Python** and **Java**
- Visual Studio Code
- Git and GitHub
- command-line tools
